dynamicRatioProcessCpu OBJECT-TYPE

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
	"The metric for the CPU of the server-process.
	 There are many metrics for the CPU of a server process, e.g.,
         kernel CPU time, user CPU time, etc. If each of these metrics
         will have a different threshold or coefficient in the weighted
         round robin in the Load Balancer, then each metric should have
         a separate OID.
	 Furthermore, if any of these metrics counts accumulated time,
         then it should be declared as Counter32 and not as Integer32."

dynamicRatioProcessMemory OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      Integer32
    MAX-ACCESS  read-only
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
	"The metric for the memory used by the server-process.
	 Same comments here as for 'dynamicRatioProcessCpu' above.
	 E.g., there is resident, shared, virtual, swapped, etc.,
         memory, and, if each of these metrics will have a different
         threshold or coefficient in the weighted round robin in the
         Load Balancer, then each metric should have a separate OID."

    ::= { dynamicRatioProcess 2 }

-- other custom process health metrics that can influence the dynamic
-- ration calculated by Weighted Round Robin by the the Load Balancer,
-- like IOPS metrics, etc.
